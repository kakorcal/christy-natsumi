        <h3>Jewelry Care</h3>
        <p>
            To ensure the longevity of the pieces we recommend protecting your purchase by removing the items during activities such as exercise, sleep, and while handling harsh chemicals such are chlorine, salt water, perfumes, cleaning agents, and lotions, among other substances.

            Sterling silver naturally tarnishes. This can be beautiful and add to the uniqueness of each piece. However, if you like to keep your silver sparkling, you can maintain itâ€™s high shine by cleaning it in warm mild soapy water. A soft polishing cloths can be used as well. Storing silver jewelry in air-tight zip lock bags can help to slow the process of oxidation. 14K Gold will not tarnish and can be cleaned with warm mild soapy water.
